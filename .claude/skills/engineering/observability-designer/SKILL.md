# Observability Designer (POWERFUL)

**Category:** Engineering  
**Tier:** POWERFUL  
**Description:** Design comprehensive observability strategies for production systems including SLI/SLO frameworks, alerting optimization, and dashboard generation.

## Overview

Observability Designer enables you to create production-ready observability strategies that provide deep insights into system behavior, performance, and reliability. This skill combines the three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, traces) with proven frameworks like SLI/SLO design, golden signals monitoring, and alert optimization to create comprehensive observability solutions.

## Core Competencies
