## Description

The Skill Tester is a comprehensive meta-skill designed to validate, test, and score the quality of skills within the claude-skills ecosystem. This powerful quality assurance tool ensures that all skills meet the rigorous standards required for BASIC, STANDARD, and POWERFUL tier classifications through automated validation, testing, and scoring mechanisms.

As the gatekeeping system for skill quality, this meta-skill provides three core capabilities:
1. **Structure Validation** - Ensures skills conform to required directory structures, file formats, and documentation standards
2. **Script Testing** - Validates Python scripts for syntax, imports, functionality, and output format compliance  
3. **Quality Scoring** - Provides comprehensive quality assessment across multiple dimensions with letter grades and improvement recommendations

This skill is essential for maintaining ecosystem consistency, enabling automated CI/CD integration, and supporting both manual and automated quality assurance workflows. It serves as the foundation for pre-commit hooks, pull request validation, and continuous integration processes that maintain the high-quality standards of the claude-skills repository.

## Core Features

### Comprehensive Skill Validation
- **Structure Compliance**: Validates directory structure, required files (SKILL.md, README.md, scripts/, references/, assets/, expected_outputs/)
- **Documentation Standards**: Checks SKILL.md frontmatter, section completeness, minimum line counts per tier
- **File Format Validation**: Ensures proper Markdown formatting, YAML frontmatter syntax, and file naming conventions

### Advanced Script Testing
- **Syntax Validation**: Compiles Python scripts to detect syntax errors before execution
- **Import Analysis**: Enforces standard library only policy, identifies external dependencies
- **Runtime Testing**: Executes scripts with sample data, validates argparse implementation, tests --help functionality
- **Output Format Compliance**: Verifies dual output support (JSON + human-readable), proper error handling

### Multi-Dimensional Quality Scoring
- **Documentation Quality (25%)**: SKILL.md depth and completeness, README clarity, reference documentation quality
- **Code Quality (25%)**: Script complexity, error handling robustness, output format consistency, maintainability
- **Completeness (25%)**: Required directory presence, sample data adequacy, expected output verification
- **Usability (25%)**: Example clarity, argparse help text quality, installation simplicity, user experience

### Tier Classification System
Automatically classifies skills based on complexity and functionality:

#### BASIC Tier Requirements
- Minimum 100 lines in SKILL.md
- At least 1 Python script (100-300 LOC)
- Basic argparse implementation
- Simple input/output handling
- Essential documentation coverage

#### STANDARD Tier Requirements  
- Minimum 200 lines in SKILL.md
- 1-2 Python scripts (300-500 LOC each)
- Advanced argparse with subcommands
- JSON + text output formats
- Comprehensive examples and references
- Error handling and edge case management

#### POWERFUL Tier Requirements
- Minimum 300 lines in SKILL.md
- 2-3 Python scripts (500-800 LOC each)
- Complex argparse with multiple modes
- Sophisticated output formatting and validation
- Extensive documentation and reference materials
- Advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- CI/CD integration capabilities

## Architecture & Design

### Modular Design Philosophy
The skill-tester follows a modular architecture where each component serves a specific validation purpose:

- **skill_validator.py**: Core structural and documentation validation engine
- **script_tester.py**: Runtime testing and execution validation framework  
- **quality_scorer.py**: Multi-dimensional quality assessment and scoring system

### Standards Enforcement
All validation is performed against well-defined standards documented in the references/ directory:
- **Skill Structure Specification**: Defines mandatory and optional components
- **Tier Requirements Matrix**: Detailed requirements for each skill tier
- **Quality Scoring Rubric**: Comprehensive scoring methodology and weightings

### Integration Capabilities
Designed for seamless integration into existing development workflows:
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Prevents substandard skills from being committed
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated quality gates in pull request workflows
- **Manual Validation**: Interactive command-line tools for development-time validation
- **Batch Processing**: Bulk validation and scoring of existing skill repositories
