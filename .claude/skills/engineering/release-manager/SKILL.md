# Release Manager

**Tier:** POWERFUL  
**Category:** Engineering  
**Domain:** Software Release Management & DevOps

## Overview

The Release Manager skill provides comprehensive tools and knowledge for managing software releases end-to-end. From parsing conventional commits to generating changelogs, determining version bumps, and orchestrating release processes, this skill ensures reliable, predictable, and well-documented software releases.

## Core Capabilities

- **Automated Changelog Generation** from git history using conventional commits
- **Semantic Version Bumping** based on commit analysis and breaking changes
- **Release Readiness Assessment** with comprehensive checklists and validation
- **Release Planning & Coordination** with stakeholder communication templates
- **Rollback Planning** with automated recovery procedures
- **Hotfix Management** for emergency releases
- **Feature Flag Integration** for progressive rollouts

## Key Components

### Scripts

1. **changelog_generator.py** - Parses git logs and generates structured changelogs
2. **version_bumper.py** - Determines correct version bumps from conventional commits
3. **release_planner.py** - Assesses release readiness and generates coordination plans

### Documentation

- Comprehensive release management methodology
- Conventional commits specification and examples
- Release workflow comparisons (Git Flow, Trunk-based, GitHub Flow)
- Hotfix procedures and emergency response protocols

## Release Management Methodology

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Semantic Versioning follows the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format where:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner  
- **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

#### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions are denoted by appending a hyphen and identifiers:
- `1.0.0-alpha.1` - Alpha releases for early testing
- `1.0.0-beta.2` - Beta releases for wider testing
- `1.0.0-rc.1` - Release candidates for final validation

#### Version Precedence

Version precedence is determined by comparing each identifier:
1. `1.0.0-alpha` < `1.0.0-alpha.1` < `1.0.0-alpha.beta` < `1.0.0-beta`
2. `1.0.0-beta` < `1.0.0-beta.2` < `1.0.0-beta.11` < `1.0.0-rc.1`
3. `1.0.0-rc.1` < `1.0.0`

### Conventional Commits

Conventional Commits provide a structured format for commit messages that enables automated tooling:

#### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types
- **feat**: A new feature (correlates with MINOR version bump)
- **fix**: A bug fix (correlates with PATCH version bump)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **breaking**: Introduces a breaking change (correlates with MAJOR version bump)

#### Examples
```
feat(user-auth): add OAuth2 integration

fix(api): resolve race condition in user creation

docs(readme): update installation instructions

feat!: remove deprecated payment API
BREAKING CHANGE: The legacy payment API has been removed
```

### Automated Changelog Generation

Changelogs are automatically generated from conventional commits, organized by:

#### Structure
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
### Changed  
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## [1.2.0] - 2024-01-15
### Added
- OAuth2 authentication support (#123)
- User preference dashboard (#145)

### Fixed
- Race condition in user creation (#134)
- Memory leak in image processing (#156)

### Breaking Changes
- Removed legacy payment API
```

#### Grouping Rules
- **Added** for new features (feat)
- **Fixed** for bug fixes (fix)
- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** for now removed features
- **Security** for vulnerability fixes

#### Metadata Extraction
- Link to pull requests and issues: `(#123)`
- Breaking changes highlighted prominently
- Scope-based grouping: `auth:`, `api:`, `ui:`
- Co-authored-by for contributor recognition

### Version Bump Strategies

Version bumps are determined by analyzing commits since the last release:

#### Automatic Detection Rules
1. **MAJOR**: Any commit with `BREAKING CHANGE` or `!` after type
2. **MINOR**: Any `feat` type commits without breaking changes
3. **PATCH**: `fix`, `perf`, `security` type commits
4. **NO BUMP**: `docs`, `style`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build` only

#### Pre-release Handling
```python
# Alpha: 1.0.0-alpha.1 → 1.0.0-alpha.2
# Beta: 1.0.0-alpha.5 → 1.0.0-beta.1  
# RC: 1.0.0-beta.3 → 1.0.0-rc.1
# Release: 1.0.0-rc.2 → 1.0.0
```

#### Multi-package Considerations
For monorepos with multiple packages:
- Analyze commits affecting each package independently
- Support scoped version bumps: `@scope/package@1.2.3`
- Generate coordinated release plans across packages

### Release Branch Workflows

#### Git Flow
```
main (production) ← release/1.2.0 ← develop ← feature/login
                                           ← hotfix/critical-fix
```

**Advantages:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Stable main branch
- Parallel feature development
- Structured release process

**Process:**
1. Create release branch from develop: `git checkout -b release/1.2.0 develop`
2. Finalize release (version bump, changelog)
3. Merge to main and develop
4. Tag release: `git tag v1.2.0`
5. Deploy from main

#### Trunk-based Development
```
main ← feature/login (short-lived)
    ← feature/payment (short-lived)  
    ← hotfix/critical-fix
```

**Advantages:**
- Simplified workflow
- Faster integration
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Continuous integration friendly

**Process:**
1. Short-lived feature branches (1-3 days)
2. Frequent commits to main
3. Feature flags for incomplete features
4. Automated testing gates
5. Deploy from main with feature toggles

#### GitHub Flow
```
main ← feature/login
    ← hotfix/critical-fix
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple and lightweight
- Fast deployment cycle
- Good for web applications
- Minimal overhead

**Process:**
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Regular commits and pushes
3. Open pull request when ready
4. Deploy from feature branch for testing
5. Merge to main and deploy

### Feature Flag Integration

Feature flags enable safe, progressive rollouts:

#### Types of Feature Flags
- **Release flags**: Control feature visibility in production
- **Experiment flags**: A/B testing and gradual rollouts
- **Operational flags**: Circuit breakers and performance toggles
- **Permission flags**: Role-based feature access

#### Implementation Strategy
```python
# Progressive rollout example
if feature_flag("new_payment_flow", user_id):
    return new_payment_processor.process(payment)
else:
    return legacy_payment_processor.process(payment)
```

#### Release Coordination
1. Deploy code with feature behind flag (disabled)
2. Gradually enable for percentage of users
3. Monitor metrics and error rates
4. Full rollout or quick rollback based on data
5. Remove flag in subsequent release

- Support team: Known issues and troubleshooting guides
- Sales team: Customer-facing changes and talking points

**External Communication:**
- Release notes for users
- API changelog for developers
- Migration guide for breaking changes
- Downtime notifications if applicable

#### Deployment Sequence
1. **Pre-deployment** (T-24h): Final validation, freeze code
2. **Database migrations** (T-2h): Run and validate schema changes  
3. **Blue-green deployment** (T-0): Switch traffic gradually
4. **Post-deployment** (T+1h): Monitor metrics and logs
5. **Rollback window** (T+4h): Decision point for rollback

#### Monitoring & Validation
- Application health checks
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- User experience monitoring
- Business metrics validation
- Third-party service integration health

### Hotfix Procedures

Hotfixes address critical production issues requiring immediate deployment:

#### Severity Classification
**P0 - Critical**: Complete system outage, data loss, security breach
- **SLA**: Fix within 2 hours
- **Process**: Emergency deployment, all hands on deck
- **Approval**: Engineering Lead + On-call Manager

**P1 - High**: Major feature broken, significant user impact
- **SLA**: Fix within 24 hours  
- **Process**: Expedited review and deployment
- **Approval**: Engineering Lead + Product Manager

**P2 - Medium**: Minor feature issues, limited user impact
- **SLA**: Fix in next release cycle
- **Process**: Normal review process
- **Approval**: Standard PR review

#### Emergency Response Process
1. **Incident declaration**: Page on-call team
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Hotfix branch**: Create from last stable release
4. **Minimal fix**: Address root cause only
5. **Expedited testing**: Automated tests + manual validation
6. **Emergency deployment**: Deploy to production
7. **Post-incident**: Root cause analysis and prevention

### Rollback Planning

Every release must have a tested rollback plan:

#### Rollback Triggers
- **Error rate spike**: >2x baseline within 30 minutes
- **Performance degradation**: >50% latency increase
- **Feature failures**: Core functionality broken
- **Security incident**: Vulnerability exploited
- **Data corruption**: Database integrity compromised

#### Rollback Types
**Code Rollback:**
- Revert to previous Docker image
- Database-compatible code changes only
- Feature flag disable preferred over code rollback

**Database Rollback:**
- Only for non-destructive migrations
- Data backup required before migration
- Forward-only migrations preferred (add columns, not drop)

**Infrastructure Rollback:**
- Blue-green deployment switch
- Load balancer configuration revert
- DNS changes (longer propagation time)

#### Automated Rollback
```python
# Example rollback automation
def monitor_deployment():
    if error_rate() > THRESHOLD:
        alert_oncall("Error rate spike detected")
        if auto_rollback_enabled():
            execute_rollback()
```

3. **Risk assessment**: Evaluate changes for potential impact
4. **Stakeholder alignment**: Ensure all teams are prepared

### Quality Assurance
1. **Automated testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
2. **Staging environment**: Production-like testing environment
3. **Canary releases**: Gradual rollout to subset of users
4. **Monitoring**: Proactive issue detection

### Communication
1. **Clear timelines**: Communicate schedules early
2. **Regular updates**: Status reports during release process
3. **Issue transparency**: Honest communication about problems
4. **Post-mortems**: Learn from incidents and improve

### Automation
1. **Reduce manual steps**: Automate repetitive tasks
2. **Consistent process**: Same steps every time
3. **Audit trails**: Log all release activities
4. **Self-service**: Enable teams to deploy safely

## Common Anti-patterns

### Process Anti-patterns
- **Manual deployments**: Error-prone and inconsistent
- **Last-minute changes**: Risk introduction without proper testing
- **Skipping testing**: Deploying without validation
- **Poor communication**: Stakeholders unaware of changes

### Technical Anti-patterns
- **Monolithic releases**: Large, infrequent releases with high risk
- **Coupled deployments**: Services that must be deployed together
- **No rollback plan**: Unable to quickly recover from issues
- **Environment drift**: Production differs from staging

### Cultural Anti-patterns
- **Blame culture**: Fear of making changes or reporting issues
- **Hero culture**: Relying on individuals instead of process
- **Perfectionism**: Delaying releases for minor improvements
- **Risk aversion**: Avoiding necessary changes due to fear

## Getting Started

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current release process and pain points
2. **Tool setup**: Configure scripts for your repository
3. **Process definition**: Choose appropriate workflow for your team
4. **Automation**: Implement CI/CD pipelines and quality gates
5. **Training**: Educate team on new processes and tools
6. **Monitoring**: Set up metrics and alerting for releases
7. **Iteration**: Continuously improve based on feedback and metrics

The Release Manager skill transforms chaotic deployments into predictable, reliable releases that build confidence across your entire organization.
