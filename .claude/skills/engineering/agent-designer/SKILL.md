## Overview

Agent Designer is a comprehensive toolkit for designing, architecting, and evaluating multi-agent systems. It provides structured approaches to agent architecture patterns, tool design principles, communication strategies, and performance evaluation frameworks for building robust, scalable AI agent systems.
